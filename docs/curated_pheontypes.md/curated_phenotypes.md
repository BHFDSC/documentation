# Curated Phenotypes

A curated phenotype is an advanced type of curated asset that involves synthesizing data, curated assets, and multiple variables to define and identify specific phenotypes. This process typically includes the integration of various datasets and the application of algorithms to derive phenotypic characteristics. For instance, curated data is used in combination with curated assets such as BMI and HbA1c and an algorithm is applied to derive a diabetes cohort table which includes a date of diabetes diagnosis and the type of diabetes a person has.
