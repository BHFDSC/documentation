# Diabetes
The <a href="https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/areas/diabetes-data-science-catalyst/" target="_blank">Diabetes Data Science Catalyst (DDSC)</a> is a collaboration between the BHF Data Science Centre, Diabetes UK, and HDR UK. The goal of the DDSC is to enhance our understanding of the connection between cardiovascular diseases and diabetes by using health data science and advanced analytics, including Artificial Intelligence, to support research that benefits both areas.

Part of the ongoing plan for the DDSC is to evaluate how best to define diabetes within the population-wide data that researchers have available. To address this, we have developed a phenotyping algorithm that will enable researchers to better define a diabetes cohort, including the date of diagnosis and type of diabetes a person has. This algorithm, and the tools provided alongside, are designed to enhance the quality and consistency of diabetes-related research.

To find out more about the development, validation and using the algorithm please click <a href="https://bhf-dsc-hds.shinyapps.io/hds_phenotypes_diabetes/" target="_blank">here</a>.
