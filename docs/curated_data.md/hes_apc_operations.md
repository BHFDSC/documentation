# HES APC Operations

## Notebook in the SDE:
Workspace/Shared/hds_team/hds_common_dev/curation/hes apc procedure codes - long-format curation

This notebook details the methodology used for creating long format HES APC operation and procedure (OPCS4) coding for use in codelist matching. The long format dataframe that is produced provides the EPISTART date relating to each OPCS4, as well as the specific operation date (OPERTN_DATE), which is captured in the OPDATE_01,...,OPDATE_23 fields in the HES_APC_OTR dataset.
