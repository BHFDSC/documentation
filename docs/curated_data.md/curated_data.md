# Curated Data

Curated data refers to datasets that have been cleaned, tidied, and formatted to enhance their usability. The primary goal of curating these data is to simplify subsequent data curation or analysis processes. Curating a data table could involve removing null records, standardising formats, and restructuring the data (e.g., pivoting tables into a long format). These steps would usually need to be performed on the data, regardless of the userâ€™s specific purpose.
