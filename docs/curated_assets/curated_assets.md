# Curated Assets

A curated asset goes beyond the initial tidying and structuring of a dataset to create a more insightful resource. This type of asset might involve integrating multiple data sources or datasets to extract specific variables of interest. For example, a curated asset might combine various datasets and codes together to derive a timeseries of BMI across a population. This makes it easier for researchers/analysts to focus on specific metrics or characteristics without having to assemble the data from scratch. Some curated assets may also apply selection algorithms to choose one record per person, ensuring that the most relevant or accurate data is represented for each individual.

## Available Versions

The curated assets are run quarterly (previously monthly), following the NHS Data Wranglers provisioning runs. The available versions are listed below.
