## Notes
- There is a reduction in data coverage around March 2020 when the COVID-19 mitigation measures began in the UK, but this quickly recovers to pre-pandemic levels after a couple of months.
- The number of TAVI procedures is increasing over time (~3900 in 2018 to ~5200 in 2021) - indications for TAVI have broadened in recent years
- The dataset contains 103 columns and 25,281 rows
- Males make up the majority of the dataset (~56%) – aortic stenosis is typically slightly more common in males than females
- The vast majority of the dataset are over 70 years old (~94%) – this is likely due to TAVI procedures only being performed on individuals who are deemed too frail for the standard surgical procedure
- The dataset is mostly of white ethnicity (95%)
- ~53% of patients are from the two least deprived quintiles – possibly due to survival bias.
