# Dataset Coverage Plot

The dataset coverage plot provides an overview of the coverage of each of the datasets provisioned in the CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT instance of the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE). 

The fainter lines indicate complexities in the coverage. For example, GDPPR data is available for patients who were alive on or after 1st November 2019; however some measures are provided for these patients from May 2018 and historical diagnoses are available from before 1990, though these are not complete.
