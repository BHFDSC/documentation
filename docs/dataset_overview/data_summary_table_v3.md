# Data summary table

<br>
This table summarises the datasets provisioned in the CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT instance of the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE), including start and end dates and update frequency and lag, as well as key notes and links to further information. For example, considering the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) - Critical Care (CC) dataset, the effective start date of data coverage is April 2008 with the end date ongoing. The HES CC dataset is updated on a monthly basis with an approximate lag of 3 months, that is, if the dataset was last updated on 2024-10-01, then the data would be considered to be complete up until around 2024-07-01 (noting that the HES data is not considered to be final until several months after the end of the financial year).

Please see the <a href="https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dataset Summary Dashboard</a> for more information about the datasets, including descriptions, links, data dictionaries, overall counts, and data coverage and variable completeness plots, and the option to be able to compare data coverage across datasets.
