# Data summary table

This table summarises the datasets provisioned in the CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT instance of the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE), including start and end dates and update frequency and lag, as well as key notes and links to further information. 

Please see the <a href="https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dataset Summary Dashboard</a> for more information about the datasets, including descriptions, links, data dictionaries, overall counts, and data coverage and variable completeness plots, and the option to be able to compare data coverage across datasets.
