# GDPPR-SNOMED Subset Analysis

## Key Findings

- GDPPR consists of a small proportion of the SNOMED universe (3.7%)
- ‘Ethnic group’ and ‘Life style’ semantic tags show 60-80% coverage  while all other semantic tags are below 25% with majority near 0%.
- Descendant code coverage were higher (~90%) among ‘Medications’, ‘Patient factors’, ‘Vaccinations and immunisations’ and ‘Declines contraindications and other exceptions’ cluster categories but low (~40%) for ‘Diagnoses and findings’.
- Coverage for codes mappable to CTV-3 were higher for ‘Respiratory disorders’ (60%) and ‘Neoplasms and cancers’ (40%) CTV-3 chapters. 

## Datasets

- SNOMED lookup
- GDPPR Refset
- GDPPR and descendants (derived from child-codes)
- CTV-3 to SNOMED mapping
