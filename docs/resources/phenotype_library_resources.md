# Phenotype Library Resources
The <a href="https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/" target="_blank">HDR UK Phenotype Library</a> is an open access, searchable repository of phenotype definitions that have been developed using electronic health records. It contains structured data and metadata describing each definition, enabling researchers to find, interpret, and re-use them easily. 

All phenotype definitions created or used in the research the BHF Data Science Centre supports are shared via the Phenotype Library, and on each projects <a href="https://github.com/bhfdsc" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, in accordance with our <a href="https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/publication-and-dissemination-policy/" target="_blank">Publication and Dissemination Policy</a> and the CVD-COVID-UK Ways of Working. You can access all the BHF Data Science Centre phenotypes in the Phenotype Library <a href="https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/HDRUK/phenotypes/?collections=20" target="_blank">here</a>, and read our full recommendations for best practice in curating and sharing phenotype definitions <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10209724" target="_blank">here</a>.

The pages below provide guidance on using the Phenotype Library, and include scripts to aid in preparing and uploading phenotypes via the Phenotype Library API. The video below covers how to upload phenotypes via the Phenotype Library Interface and via the API.
