# Codelist Comparison Tool

Research projects that utilise electronic health records typically require multiple codelists, across various coding terminologies, to accurately define phenotpyes and generate cohorts. Often this involves gathering established codelists, which can be large and complex, and may not fully align with the focus of a specific project. A carefully constructed and considered codelist is crucial to ensure research outcomes are both accurate and meaningful.

The Codelist Comparison Tool was developed to simplify the comparison of codelists and ultimately support the creation and curation of a refined and project-specific codelist. The tool integrates external libraries, including the <a href="https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/" target="_blank">HDR UK Phenotype Library</a> and <a href="https://www.opencodelists.org/" target="_blank">OpenCodelists</a>, with user-generated datasets to enhance research workflows and generate more accurate and tailored codelists. 

Key features of the tool include:

- the ability to compare codelists to identify overlap, missing codes and inconsistencies
- mapping of medical codes to descriptions
- supporting the comparison to the GDPPR refset
- mapping codes to the number of people in the NHS England SDE who have those specific codes, offering insights into prevalence
- allowing users to build and export their own codelists for use in project pipelines
